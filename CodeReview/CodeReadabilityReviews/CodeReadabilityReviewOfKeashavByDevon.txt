= The level loader for level 1-4 is even more complex than the level loader for 1-1, so it's a bit of a chore to look
  at, but this is largly unavoidable and is rectified by being familiar with the code and its purpose.

= For both the LevelLoader and LevelLoaderOneOne (for level 1-1, as the name implies), the use of holes as a flag for 
  when to start and stop putting ceiling and floor blocks is nice, but a tad hard to wrap the mind around when reading
  for the first time.

= It may not be the case, but it looks to me there are a few methods unused (can be cleaned up), but overall it's not
  the worst I've seen.
