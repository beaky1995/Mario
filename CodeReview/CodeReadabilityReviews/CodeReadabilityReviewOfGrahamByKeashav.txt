The Bowser class does very well in terms of cyclomatic complexity. The logic is nicely segregated which makes for clear and concise code.
One downside is that the class is over 100 lines of code but that is expected from a Boss character like Bowser.
rand.Next(3) could probably be rand.Next(BowserUtil.RandomMoves)
Overall, the Bowser class is very readable.
